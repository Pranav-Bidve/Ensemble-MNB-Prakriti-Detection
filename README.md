## This project addresses overlapping 'Prakriti' clusters  by analyzing multiple characteristics of individuals, clustering data into seven groups using the k-modes method.

Ayurveda, an ancient holistic medical science from the Indian subcontinent, classifies individuals based on 'doshas'—three fundamental energies governing the body and mind. Each person has a unique combination of these doshas, influencing their physical, mental, and emotional characteristics. This project expands the traditional three-segment classification of 'Prakriti' types into seven overlapping categories using k-modes clustering to better capture the intricate combinations of 'doshas'.

* 'Prakriti' in Ayurveda categorizes individuals into three primary types 'doshas'—'VATT-Dosha', 'PITT-Dosha', and 'KAPH-Dosha'.

* This project expands the three 'Prakriti' types into seven categories, including overlapping 'doshas' like 'VATT-PITT-Dosha' and 'PITT-KAPH-Dosha'.
  
* K-modes clustering groups individuals into seven overlapping categories, tailored for categorical data by considering the mode of each attribute.
